Description: Provides tools for quantifying visual threat intensity at
    riverine locations based on environmental and anthropogenic stressors.
    The package calculates a unified Threat Intensity Score (T) using
    normalized and weighted inputs from threats such as fishing activity,
    human disturbance, and water level variation etc. Functions are included
    for threat normalization, score computation, and threat level
    classification etc. Includes sample datasets and a detailed vignette
    to support ecological assessments and conservation planning.
